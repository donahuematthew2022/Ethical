     Scenario
   </h2>Why You Should Buy
   <p> Someone you know works at a store that sells ipods. He/She steals some and asks if you want to buy one for half the price the store sells it for. Should you buy it? Why or Why not?
   </p>
   
   <h2><text decoration Why You Should Buy</h2>
   <p> One reason to buy would be if you don't have that much money for what the store sells them for. Or you don't carre about getting caught.  </p>
   
   
   <h2> Why You Shouldn't Buy</h2>
   <p> One reason to not buy would be the consequences of being caught with stolen property. Not only would you have the headphones taken away but you would also lose the money that you spent on them.   </p>
